# mlLib
On the path to create mlLib on Spark with Tensor Analysis.

The starting point for this project is an excellent repo described by original authors (Marek Kolodziej et al). The choice is very clear as you will see that the method of data distribution is abstracted from the functional components (algorithms). Neat thing is that the data itself is packaged in vectorized form regardless of mem data store and distribution methods.
